## The Problem

### Influencer Marketing is Broken

The influencer marketing industry faces critical challenges that cost brands billions annually:

**1. Lack of Transparency**
- Brands pay creators upfront without performance guarantees
- No way to verify actual reach or engagement
- Fake followers and inflated metrics are rampant
- 15-25% of influencer budgets lost to fraud

**2. Trust Gap**
- Creators fear non-payment or delayed payments
- Brands worry about ROI and authenticity
- No standardized payment terms
- Disputes require costly mediation

**3. Inefficient Payment Systems**
- Manual invoice processing and approval chains
- International payments take days with high fees
- Payment platforms charge 5-15% transaction fees
- No real-time performance tracking

**4. Entry Barriers**
- Small creators cannot access brand deals
- Brands struggle to find genuine micro-influencers
- Platform gatekeepers control access and pricing
- Centralized marketplaces take 20-40% cuts

**Current Market Stats:**
- Global influencer marketing: $21 billion (2023)
